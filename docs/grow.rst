Grow
====

Here are your options when growing your codebase or scaling your application.

Extension
---------

It's a good idea to write your awesome extensions. Axe is just a skeleton, it's
your choice to inject which kind of soul.

Proxy
-----

Split an enormous codebase into several small and delicate codebases. It's good
to keep codebase in a proper size. You may run many progresses and use server
applications, like Nginx, Apache, to dispatch request to the right process. Or
you might want them to work in the same progress: just combine them by the proxy
method into a larger one based on prefix. See :ref:`scale-application`.
